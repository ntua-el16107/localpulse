This is a project made for the [Human-Computer Interaction course](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3362) (7th Semester at the Computer Software track) at the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens.

We were assigned to create an **Android Application** using the **Flutter Framework** and the **Material UI** while the application prototypes where designed using **Figma**.

We also had to include Collaborative & Social Computing via a personalized recommendation system, Wi-Fi, Mobile Data and GPS connectivity and various Human-Computer Interaction features via the Camera and Augmented Reality via optical character recognition. 

[Here are the prototypes and assets designed in Figma using the Material UI](https://www.figma.com/file/9gL52kesbn9R9FAsPZhhMn/LocalPulse?node-id=52696%3A23855&t=C6SqTn8k7i1fH6gL-1).
